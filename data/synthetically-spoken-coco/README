Synthetically Spoken Coco

Version 1.0

This dataset contain synthetically generated spoken versions of MS COCO [1] captions. 
The speech was generated using gTTS [2]. The dataset consists of the following files:

- dataset.json: Captions associated with MS COCO images. This information comes from [3]. 
- mp3.tgz: MP3 files with the audio. Each file name corresponds to caption ID in dataset.json.
- dataset.mfcc.npy: Numpy array with the Mel Frequence Cepstral Coefficients extracted from 
  the audio. Each row corresponds to a caption. Rows are in the same order as the captions in
  dataset.json. MFCCs were extracted using [4].
