# reimaginet

Visually grounded word and sentence representations

Reimaginet is the new version of [Imaginet](https://github.com/gchrupala/imaginet), 
which was originally introduced in [ChrupaÅ‚a et al 2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03694).

In this repository we are trying new models and features. 

## Pre-requisites

Reimaginet relies on [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) and [funktional](https://github.com/gchrupala/funktional). 

Once you have these installed, you can install `reimaginet`. If you'll be making changes to the code it's best to install in the development mode, so all the changes are used by the Python interpreter:

```
> cd reimaginet
> python setup.py develop --user
```
